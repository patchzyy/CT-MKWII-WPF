# Open Source Mario Kart Wii Mod Manager


**Currently only supports RR**

Please report any bugs :)

## Todo:
- error detection if config.json contains invalid information
- combined mods should have a clearer name, not just the name of the top mod
- Disclamer on what Reccomended settings does
- Possible shortcut on desktop (ask on first time launch)
- how to get around that stupid (windows protected your pc) popup
- multiple times clicking on update. limit to one

## Done:
- My-stuff manager
- Auto-update the program itself (On launch it will ask the user to update)
- No nand error message after first time launch
- move config.json and rr.json (if its created) to %appdata/MWiiManager
- UI rework (add tabs top bar for settings, my-stuff, game, x)
- A bug can appear where GFX.ini is trying to be found in the LOAD instead of user folder
